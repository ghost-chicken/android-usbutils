usbutils for Android
====================

Building:
---------

To build usbutils for Android do the following:

 1. NDK requirements

    1.1. Download the latest NDK from:
         https://developer.android.com/ndk

    1.2. Extract the NDK.

    1.3. Open a shell and make sure there exist an NDK global variable
         set to the directory where you extracted the NDK.

         For example: export NDK="/opt/ndk-bundle"

 2. libusb requirements

    2.1. Clone or download the latest libusb source code from:
         https://github.com/libusb/libusb

    2.1. Extract the libusb archive when ZIP file was downloaded.

    2.2. Make sure there exists an LIBUSB global variable set to the
         directory where you extracted the libusb archive or cloned
         the repository.

         For example: export LIBUSB="/tmp/libusb"

 3. usbhid-dump requirements

    3.1. Change directory to usbutils source code and update the git
         submodules when usbutils source code was cloned from origin
         GitHub repository:

         git submodule init
         git submodule update

    3.2. Download and extract the usbhid-dump source archive into the
         usbutils source code directory when usbutils source code was
         not cloned from origin GitHub repository. Download ZIP file
         from: https://github.com/DIGImend/usbhid-dump

 3. Change directory to usbutils's "android/jni"

 4. Run "$NDK/ndk-build".

The usbutils and the libusb library can then be found in:
    "android/libs/$ARCH"

Where $ARCH is one of:
    armeabi
    armeabi-v7a
    mips
    mips64
    x86
    x86_64

Installing:
-----------

For a rooted device it is possible to install usbutils into the data area
of a running device and set the execution permission and/or remount the
data area with the flags "rw,exec":

 1. Enable ADB on the device.

 2. Connect the device to a machine running ADB.

 3. Explore the ADB device list and looking for your running device:

    adb devices -l

 4. Make sure there exists an ADEV and ARCH global variable set to your
    running device and the right architecture (see list above), ex.:

    ADEV="0123456789ABCDEF"
    ARCH="armeabi-v7a"

 5. Make sure there exists an ADIR global variable set to the data area
    directory of your running device:

    ADIR="/data"

 3. Execute the following commands on the machine running ADB:

    # Create a sample directory
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell mkdir -p ${ADIR}/sample
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell ls -ald ${ADIR}/sample

    # Install usbutils
    adb -s ${ADEV} push -p ../libs/${ARCH} ${ADIR}/sample
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell ls -al ${ADIR}/sample
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell chmod 777 ${ADIR}/sample/lsusb
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell chmod 777 ${ADIR}/sample/usbreset
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell chmod 777 ${ADIR}/sample/usbhid-dump

    # Run lsusb to
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ADIR}/sample ${ADIR}/sample/lsusb
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ADIR}/sample ${ADIR}/sample/usbreset

For a non rooted device it is possible to install usbutils into the sdcard
area as shown above (with ADIR="/sdcard") but neither you will be able to
set execution permition or remount with "rw,exec" nor you have a chance to
execute the lsusb utility. You will get an error message such like this:

/system/bin/sh: /sdcard/lsusb: can't execute: Permission denied

Runtime Permissions:
--------------------

The default system configuration on most Android device may cause
runtime permission errors. Read the corresponding section in the
libusb source code:
